                    <p class="designDesc"><img src="images/betterHelp.jpg" alt="better help page">The Better Helpwebsite is a realy well done example of the rule of thirds. If you were to put a 3x3 grid on this website and follow it all the way down, you would notice that almost every itme fits somewhere in a third. This makes the website easier to take in and more inviting.</p>

                    <p class="designDesc"><img src="images/barberPopShop.jpg" alt="barberpop shop homepage">The BarberPop Shop does well in the aspect of Hick's Law which is that the more content you have, the less likely someone is going to make a decision or stick around.
