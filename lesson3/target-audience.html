        <h1>Target Audience</h1>
        <p>The target audience is the people of Fayetteville, Arkansas. More specifically those who are looking to be involed in their community and support local businesses. Usually this audience is comprised of young adults who are looking to grow their career. However, there is a large population of middle aged people in Fayetteville meaning that I will focus more on that generation to help them get motivated to get involved.</p>
